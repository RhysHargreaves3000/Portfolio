       <center><h2><b>HTML/CSS</b></h2></center>
       <center><p>Starting in 2016 I was taught basic HTML in highschool, this involved(from what I remembered and had saved) making a very simple 3 page functional website that contained a homepage with image links to the other 2 pages,
         a basic contact page with a google map embed and ordered and unordered lists, then the last page containing a video, a sound file and a forum submit feature. I did pretty much the same thing in 2017/18 college with the addition of uploading
       it to a server and adding photoshopped images/transitions ect. Then it came to 2019/20, this is where we started using CSS, these were used to make functional webpages with mobile support.</p></center>

      <center><h2><b>Adobe Suite</b></h2></center>
      <center><p>Although I have only used Adobe Suite in my time as a College student, I am confident when I say that I am Very Literate in this area.
      We started of course in 2017-18 with NQ Digital media, we learned how all these programs worked on a very basic level and came back to it in 2019-20, this is where I feel like I Solidified my knowledge
    and familiarity with these products, although I do not have much of my school work to show I think it is important to say that the work doesn't represent my maximum effort and capabilities on these softwares</p></center>

      <center><h2><b>Office365</b></h2></center>
      <center><p>Office is an Incredibly versatile thing in my day to day life, I keep track of my finances and time with Excel, Constantly write DND Info and collaborate with friends in word and this is just the home uses I have,
         I started using these products as early as 2014 in Highschool Business Management class, covering Product design, basic Exel formulas and charts, this picked up again in college of course as I learned more Advanced techniques and
       handled more advanced problems </p></center>

          <center><h2><b>Wireframing & Iterations</b></h2></center>
          <center><p>I enjoy the process of Wireframing alot, it allows you to map out and rationalize the idea in your head(or in a clients head) and figure out very early whether certain ideas will mesh
          with other ideas and where you have room to be creative, the whole process is important but without wireframes and conceptualisation your idea stays an idea </p></center>
